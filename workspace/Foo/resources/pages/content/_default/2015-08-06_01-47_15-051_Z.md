#Introduction

In this lab, we will define the business model and 
businesses store, and show the results on the map.


#Steps

??Define the business model
 
You need to define a model for the businesses feed, 
which<a href="http://traininglabs.sencha.com/api/yelp/v2/search/?term=laundry&ll=33.6751155,-95.5316914" target="lab">looks like this</a>.

Note that the array of record data is in a property called +businesses+. 
This is specified by the reader's +rootProperty+.

Each datum is in the format we want, so we can use +type:'auto'+ for every field. 
The location (latitude and longitude) of a business is nested, so you need to use 
+mapping+ to specify the location.

In the `app/model/` folder create the file `app/model/Business.js`. Code the class using this starter code:

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.model.Business', {
        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',

        proxy: {}
        
    });

Use this proxy:

    proxy: {
        type: 'ajax',
        url: 'http://traininglabs.sencha.com/api/yelp/v2/search/',
        reader: {
            type: 'json',
            rootProperty: 'businesses'
        }
    }

The proxy creates an instance of `Ext.data.proxy.JsonP` using its alias. Therefore, that class
needs to be required. At the top of the class descriptor add the requires:

    requires: ['Ext.data.proxy.JsonP']

Then add this fields array:

    fields: [{
        name: 'latitude',
        mapping: 'location.coordinate.latitude'
    }, {
        name: 'longitude',
        mapping: 'location.coordinate.longitude'
    }]

When you're finished `model/Business.js` should look like this:
<pre class="runnable 300">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.model.Business', {
    extend: 'Ext.data.Model',
    requires: ['Ext.data.proxy.JsonP'],
    fields: [{
        name: 'latitude',
        mapping: 'location.coordinate.latitude'
    }, {
        name: 'longitude',
        mapping: 'location.coordinate.longitude'
    }],
    proxy: {
        type: 'ajax',
        url: 'http://traininglabs.sencha.com/api/yelp/v2/search/',
        reader: {
            type: 'json',
            rootProperty: 'businesses'
        }
    }
});
</pre>

??Define the businesses store
 
Edit `app/view/main/MainModel.js` and add a stores config for businesses, coded like this:

    stores: {
        businesses: { 
            model: 'YelpExtplorer.model.Business',
            pageSize: 20 // Yelp limits results to 20 at a time
        }
    }

 
This code results in the store being populated with *YelpExtplorer.model.Business* instances. 
As usual, when a class creates an object, the object's class needs to be loaded. Therefore, you 
need to add +requires:['YelpExtplorer.model.Business']+ to the view model class definition.

When you are finished, the view model should look like this:
<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.ViewModel',
    alias: 'viewmodel.main',
    requires: ['YelpExtplorer.model.Business'],
    data: {
        location: {
            // Bismark, ND
            latitude: 46.809076,
            longitude: -100.7670546
        }
    },
    stores: {
        businesses: {
            model: 'YelpExtplorer.model.Business',
            pageSize: 20 // Yelp limits results to 20 at a time
        }
    }
});</pre>

??Load the store

The store needs to be loaded with data whenever the location changes. To do that, edit
`app/view/main/MainController.js` and add this method:

<pre class="runnable readonly text 360">
load: function() {
    // Loading the store runs the Yelp URL, passing in a "ll" param, which is set 
    // to the location latitide and longitude. Those values are in the '{location} 
    // in the view model. 
    
    var vm = this.getViewModel();
    var location = vm.get('location');
    if (!location) return;
    var store = vm.getStore('businesses');
    
    // Yelp expects something like &ll=43.084,-89.546
    var params = {
        ll: (location.latitude + ',' + location.longitude)
    };
    store.load({
        params: params
    });
}</pre>

The method gets a local reference to the view model. If the location has been established,
it then runs +load()+ on the businesses store, passing the *ll* parameter used by the Yelp
server &mdash; it returns 20 businesses around that location.

You want the method to be run as the location changes. Therefore, add this statement to the
+initViewModel+ method:

    vm.bind('{location}', me.load, me);

This isn't buffered, because setting location is already buffered as the user types the city.

If you save and refresh, you won't see anything in the user interface yet, because you haven't
wired the map to the store. However, if you look at network traffic you should see the call to
fetch the data. If you type this in the debugger console you should get 20 &mdash; the number
of businesses returned by Yelp

    Ext.first('app-main').getViewModel().getStore('businesses').getCount();


??Bind the businesses store to the map

Edit the tab panel view, and code the map config to have its +store+ bound to the businesses store. 

    {
        title: 'Map',
        xtype: 'businessesmap',
        bind: {
            location: '{location}',
            store: '{businesses}'
        }
    }


Save and refresh the browser window. You should see markers on the map for the initial location hard-coded
in the main view model. If you type a city, and wait a second, you should see the map center on that location
and markers.

??Select a default city

Rather than a default location, it might be more logical to have a default city.

Edit `app/view/main/MainModel.js` and remove the location from the data section, and instead, add
a *city*. Do something like this:

    data: {
        city: 'Redwood City, CA'
    }

If you save your changes, and refresh the brower, you should see the map centered on the city, with map
markers.


??Add category to the Yelp request

You need to add the code that lets the user send category information to Yelp.

First, replace the view controller's  +load+ method with this:

<pre class="runnable readonly text 360">
load: function() {
    // Loading the store runs the Yelp URL, passing in a "ll" param, which is set 
    // to the location latitide and longitude. Those values are in the '{location} 
    // in the view model. 
    
    var vm = this.getViewModel();
    var location = vm.get('location');
    var category = vm.get('category');
    if (!location) return;
    var store = vm.getStore('businesses');
    
    // Yelp expects something like &ll=43.084,-89.546&term=pizza
    var params = {
        ll: (location.latitude + ',' + location.longitude)
    };
    if (category) {
        params.term = category;
    }
    store.load({
        params: params
    });
    vm.set('business', null);
}</pre>

It's just like you had before, but it also includes category in the query. 

Then edit `app/view/main/MainModel.js` and hard-code an initial value for +category+, such as *coffee*

Finally, edit `app/view/main/MainController.js` and, in the +initViewModel+ method, bind a buffered 
function to *{category}* using this code:

    vm.bind('{category}', Ext.Function.createBuffered(me.load, 1000, me));


When you're finished, you'll see your initial city and category being reflected on the map. If you type a city
or category, you'll see the results on the map.

??But there's a small problem...

You may have noticed that as you refresh the browser, there's a one second delay before the 
businesses are fetched. That's because of the buffered calls set up in the controller. Waiting 
a second makes sense *as the user types*, but it doesn't make sense when the app first starts. To fix 
this you will change the properties that are set as the user types. 

The bindings are specified in either `Main.js` or `Filter.js`, 
depending on whether you worked the optional Publishes lab. 

- If you coded the optional Publishes lab, edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and change the businesses filter bindings from *{city}* and *{category}*, 
to *{typedCity}* and *{typedCategory}*.
- If you did <u>not</u> code the optional lab, edit `app/view/businesses/Filter.js` and change the bindings in text field and category fields from *{city}* and *{category}*, 
to *{typedCity}* and *{typedCategory}*.

Now edit `app/view/main/MainController.js` and replace +initViewModel+ with this code:

<pre class="runnable text readonly">
initViewModel: function(vm) {
    var me = this;

    // Typed values should always reflect {city} and {category}.
    vm.bind('{city}', function(city){
        vm.set('typedCity', city)'
    });
    vm.bind('{category}', function(category){
        vm.set('typedCategory', category)'
    });
    
    // When the user types, wait a second before updating {city} and {category}
    vm.bind('{typedCity}', Ext.Function.createBuffered(function(city) {
        vm.set('city', city);
    }, 1000));
    vm.bind('{typedCategory}', Ext.Function.createBuffered(function(category) {
        vm.set('category', category);
    }, 1000));

    vm.bind('{city}', me.geocodeCity, me);
    vm.bind('{location}', me.load, me);
    vm.bind('{category}', me.load, me);

}
</pre>

This code is very close to what you had before, but it uses buffered functions to have 
*typedCity* and *typedCategory*  update *city* and *category*. This allows the initial 
values in the view model to take effect immediately. 

Save and refresh, and everything should work and, but there should be no initial delay 
in fetching businesses. Test the code by typing a city and category and verifying that,
after a second, the data is fetched. 


# Conclusion

You've created a *Business* model class, and a *businesses* store in the view model. The store
is loaded whenever the location changes. The location changes whenever the city changes. The map
is bound to *{location}*, which automatically runs +setLocation()+ whenever the view model property 
changes. The map is also bound to *{businesses}* &mdash; the map shows markers for the businesses
whenever the map is loaded.
